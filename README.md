Eternal September Initiative

Description:
The Eternal September Initiative is designed to drive curiosity and learning, not simply create a final product. This area displays the key understandings I want to achieve, the projects I've created for practice and proficiency, and the data I've collected along the way. I intend for these trials to be rigorous but whimsical, as is my nature. I will be covering heavy topics and complicated projects as well as silly, playful ones.
